# Hi I'm Jeff ðŸ‘‹

I'm a highly-experienced team manager and software developer specializing in web and mobile applications. With over 10 years of experience, I have enjoyed building intuitive well-tested products for consumers and businesses in a variety of industries.

Outside of development I enjoy spending time with my family, playing the travel points game, and the occasional trashy TV.
